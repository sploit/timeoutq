Timeout Queue

Preform a set task against a set of data elements after a given timeout
has been reached.

My use case is for preforming garbage collection of stale elements from
hash table.

Call chain:

/* Create a new tmq */
tmq_create ();

/* Create a new element */
tmq_element_create ();

/* Add new element to the tmq */
tmq_insert ();

/* find an element that was already inserted */
tmq_find ();

/* reset the timer for an element */
tmq_bump ();

/* premptively delete an element from the tmq */
tmq_delete ();

/* timeout the expired elements */
tmq_timeout ();
